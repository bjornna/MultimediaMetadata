Multimedia Metadata
Problem: 
How to handle the ever growing multimedia production in family?
How can I search for video or images with specific persons in? How can I search for video or images from a given event? 

Solution: 
I want to create a solution to import multimedia entities and annotated them with metadata. 
Programming language will be Java. 
I think MPEG-7 can be used.
